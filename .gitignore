# Uncomment these types if you want even more clean repository. But be careful.
# It can make harm to an existing project source. Read explanations below.

# Resource files are binaries containing manifest, project icon and version info.
# They can not be viewed as text or compared by diff-tools. Consider replacing them with .rc files.

# Since Delphi 2009 it is produced from .ridl file and can safely be ignored.
